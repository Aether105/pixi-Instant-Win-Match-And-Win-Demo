### How to Run (Using Live Server)

Because of browser security policies (specifically **CORS**), you can't simply open the `index.html` file directly from your computer's file system. So, to run this project, you need a local web server. The easiest way to do this is by using the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.
If you already have it, you can proceed straight to step 4.

#### Steps:

1.  **Install VS Code**: If you don't already have it, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2.  **Install Live Server Extension**:

    * Open VS Code.

    * Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).

    * Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey and click **Install**.

3.  **Open Project in VS Code**:

    * Open the folder containing the `index.html` and `main.js` files in VS Code (File > Open Folder...).

4.  **Go Live!**:

    * Right-click on the `index.html` file in the VS Code Explorer.

    * Select **"Open with Live Server"** from the context menu.

    * Alternatively, you can click the **"Go Live"** button located in the bottom right corner of the VS Code status bar.

Live Server will then automatically launch this project in your default web browser, typically at an address like `http://127.0.0.1:5500`. This will allow the game to run correctly without any CORS errors!
